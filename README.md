# No-Calorie Burger

Bizarre Trilogy coding project where users can input a burger name (or really anything else they want), and their input will be displayed in a 'Burgers to Eat' box. Clicking the 'eat' button next to these burgers will move them to the 'Devoured Burgers' box. Why? Who knows.

*No burgers were enjoyed or harmed in making this app.
